                <p>Down syndrome or Down's syndrome,[12] also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.[3] It is usually associated with developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic physical features.[1][13]</p>
                <p>The parents of the affected individual are usually genetically normal.[14] The incidence of the syndrome increases with the age of the mother, from less than 0.1% for 20-year-old mothers to 3% for those of age 45.[4] It is believed to occur by chance, with no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the probability.[2] Three different genetic forms have been identified. The most common, trisomy 21, involves an extra copy of chromosome 21 in all cells.[15] The extra chromosome is provided at conception as the egg and sperm combine.[16] Translocation Down syndrome involves attachment of extra chromosome 21 material.[17][18] In 1–2% of cases, the additional chromosome is added in the embryo stage and only affects some of the cells in the body; this is known as Mosaic Down syndrome.[19][15]</p>
